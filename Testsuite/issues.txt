Editfield gets no focus
An input requires that the player has to click into the editfield.
Check it with the "Wherigo Testsuite" > Item "Inputs"

Timerevent "On Start" doesn't work
A timer from type intervall doesn't fire if an action is in the On Start event.
Check it with the "Wherigo Testsuite" > Item "Phone 1"

Intervalltimer does not stop
If an intervall timer is started, it can not be stopped in its own cycle.
Known issue on garmin (its always better stopping with another event), but some players work with it.
Check it with the "Wherigo Testsuite" > Item "Timertests" > Count

Picturesize not adjusting 
Bug or feature ? ;-) Pictures keep their original dimensions.
Bad, because there are a lot of different screen resolutions on player devices. 
I would suggest to make it configurable that pictures keep their size or will fit to screen.
Check it with the "Wherigo Testsuite" > Item "Picturesize"

WF.Player sometimes crashes (hard)
At start of a cartridge or while running the wf.player gets a blank screen,
only with title (see pic attached). The player don't respond. After killing the task it is not possible to start again.
The blank screen will be shown again. Only after rebooting the device the wf.player can be
started again. It happens on different cartridges at different points. So its not possible
that a certain cartridge is the reason.

Unfortunately not to check and nothing informative things in the logfile.
How about a continously written debugfile ?
It happens not so rarely, I would say on 10 playerstarts it crashes in 2 or 3 cases.

Player too large
Seems there is the whole development studio inside the app ;-) 1 DLL (mono.android.dll) has already 17 MB !

Settings and configuration missing
There is nothing to configure

Offline Map missing
No way to show a map, neither offline nor online.
